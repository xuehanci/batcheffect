# Prediction with Batch Effect Correction on RNA-seq Data

Predicting outcomes or performing statistical analyses on RNA-seq data with batch effect correction is an important step to ensure that the results are not confounded by technical variations introduced during sample processing. Batch effects can arise from various sources such as differences in sample preparation, sequencing runs, or other experimental conditions. 

This project aimed to improve the performance of microbiome-based prediction models via incorporation of batch correction. Our approach is to incorporate three different batch correction methods - ComBat-Seq, ConQuR, and MMUPHin - to address and remove batch effects in the RNA- seq data. By using these methods, the project aimed to ensure that the microbiome data was properly normalized and corrected for any batch effects. Random Forest and Lasso regression will be used as the predicting method.
